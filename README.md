This repository contains a collection of essential preprocessing techniques for Natural Language Processing (NLP), including:

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into sentences and words.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common words that don't add much meaning.
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
- **Lemmatization**: Mapping words to their base form based on context and meaning.
- **Regular Expressions**: Matching and extracting patterns in text for data cleaning.
- **Part of Speech (POS) Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical structure of sentences.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting entities like names, dates, and locations from text.
- **Spell Checking**: Correcting spelling errors in the text to improve accuracy.

## Purpose

This repository is designed for anyone interested in learning or applying NLP preprocessing techniques using Python. Each technique is demonstrated with clear examples and code, making it easier for developers to understand and implement these steps in their projects.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK
- SpaCy
- Regular Expressions
- SpellChecker

## Getting Started
